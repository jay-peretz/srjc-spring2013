<p>Welcome to HTML5 Interactive Web Spring 2013.  This was a very popular class, we could have filled several more sections, so consider yourselves lucky and take full advantage of the opportunity.  <a href="mailto:jperetz@santarosa.edu" class="btn-info">Send me an email</a> if you have questions about the curriculum, course dynamics and whether this is the right course for you.   There are many other students who would love to have a seat in this class and we are completely filled at this point.  </p>
<p>This class will instruct you in the techniques and tools used to create websites that use the absolutely latest features of web browsers, including HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript/JQuery, to create interactive, dynamic websites that respond to users and their devices seamlessly.While all of the web development classes at Santa Rosa Junior College now teach these techniques, this course was designed for those who already know HTML, CSS, and hopefully a bit of Javascript as well.</p>
<p>This class is being taught completely online this semester. This webpage will be the one place to go<strong> at least weekly</strong> to see what we're learning and doing in the class.  You can read all the specifics about the class in general below, and post any questions you have to the discussion forum at the bottom of the page.</p>
<p>Each week's lesson will include some readings, an exercise and some  resources for you to explore on your own.</p>
<p>Please start by reading the general class information below and then follow the instructions under readings and exercise to follow this week's lesson.</p>

<p>Welcome to CS53.11B Advanced Dreamweaver Spring 2013.  This class is very popular and is completely filled at this point.   <a href="mailto:jperetz@santarosa.edu" class="btn-info">Send me an email</a> if you have questions about the curriculum, course dynamics and whether this is the right course for you.   There are many other students who would love to have a seat in this class and we are completely filled at this point.</p>
<p>This class is designed to instruct you in how to create dynamic web applications using HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, JQuery, PHP and MySQL.  While I will be using Adobe Dreamweaver in the class lectures and there are many features of Dreamweaver that help us as a development tool, we will be focusing on the technologies and techniques and so Dreamweaver is not necessarily required if you have a different preference (or limited budget) for development tools. This course is in transition and will focus on the server-side programming techniques using PHP, MySQL and techniques such as AJAX, JSON and REST. </p>
<p>This is a lecture based class in Petaluma on Wednesday evenings at 7PM.  That said, attendance in class is not required and all lectures will be broadcast, captioned and archived for later viewing. While we encourage you to attend in person, it is possible to live out of town and take this class.</p>
<p>Whether you attend the lectures or not, this webpage is the place to go at least weekly to see what we're learning and doing in the class. You can read all the specifics about the class in general below, and post any questions you have to the discussion forum at the bottom of this page.  </p>
